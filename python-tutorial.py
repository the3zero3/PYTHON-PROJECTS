# Purpose:  The Tech Academy - Python Course, Creating our first program together.
#           Demonstrating how to pass variables from function to function
#           while producing a functional game.
#
#           Remember, function_name(variable) _means that we pass in the variable.
#           return variable _means that we are returning the variable to
#           back to the calling function.
